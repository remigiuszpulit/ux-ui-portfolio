            As it clearly can be seen our end users are not satisfied with the
            present processes which instead of making their work easier, just
            add additional ammount of paperwork. Moerover, workers often have
            issues with picking correct tools and parts needed to complete the
            task, and the manager often has issues with people, tasks and
            warehouse management.

        Knowing the needs and concerns of users, I was able to compare them with

        The team could not resist from coming up with new features before the
        Ideate phase. However things not always go your way, sometimes there is
        a need to stop and review the processes within the team. To create a
        valuable product that really solves users' problems, each member of the
        team should be involved. Therefore I have decided to hold an offline
        workshop for my team to help everyone empathise with the user and at the
        same time find out why do we need the UX and UI.

        Thanks to the stationary workshops we have increased the collective
        understanding of the users' needs. As the workshop task I have picked
        the 90minutes prototype challenge, to introduce my team into the world
        of research and testing as their task was to create paper prototypes of
        an application. To ensure approach not biased by their everyday work, it
        was decided by voting that the app that will be designed will be a
        medical app. I have split the team in two and took the role of a
        consultant myself. At the end of an intensive day we held a presentation
        of both solutions and conducted AB tests on other employees.

        After getting to know the way of my team's thinking I went back to
        designing our app's processes. New concepts emerged together with a
        feature allowing to create and manage manuals within the system.The
        design of each feature involved design cycles including user-flow
        design, low and high fidelity wireframes. Each stage was either
        consulted with the team or tested based on available time and resources.
        Below are a couple of examples of such stages.
